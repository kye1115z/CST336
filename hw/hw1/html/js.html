            <p class="content">
              In 1993, the Mosaic web browser, known as the precursor to modern
              graphical web browsers, was born at NCSA. It was the first web
              browser to display text and images simultaneously in one window,
              and it included UI elements that made it easy to use, even for
              people who were not familiar with computers at the time.
              <br /><br />
              Marc Andreessen, who led the development team of the Mosaic web
              browser, founded a company called Netscape immediately after
              graduating from university. In 1994, Marc developed the technology
              of the Mosaic web browser further and created the Netscape
              Navigator browser, which incorporated even more UI elements. At
              that time, only static websites could be created using HTML and
              CSS, allowing only basic page linking for navigation. This led
              Marc to continue pondering, "How can I create dynamic websites?"

          <p class="title">The Birth of a New Language</p>
          <div>
            <p class="content">
              &nbsp;Marc decided to add a scripting language to the web. He
              envisioned creating dynamic elements by manipulating DOM elements
              within the websites viewed by users.
              <br />
              &nbsp;At the time, Java was gaining popularity but was considered
              too heavy for the developers working primarily on websites.
              Therefore, Marc recruited Brendan Eich and chose to modify the
              existing Scheme language for this purpose. The concept of Scheme
              was maintained, but its syntax was made more Java-like.
              <br />
              &nbsp;In September 1994, Brendan created a new language internally
              called Mocha. This language was later renamed LiveScript, and the
              LiveScript engine (interpreter) that could understand and execute
              LiveScript was included in the Netscape Navigator browser.
              <br />
              &nbsp;At that time, the Java language was enjoying BTS-level
              popularity. To ride the wave of Java’s success, the name
              LiveScript was changed to JavaScript, marking the birth of
              JavaScript.

            <p class="content">
              &nbsp;Seeing the vast potential of browsers with Netscape
              Navigator, Microsoft felt a pressing need to develop their own
              browser. They decided to reverse-engineer Netscape Navigator
              (Reverse Engineering - the process of analyzing a program to
              restore its source code).
              <br />
              <br />
              &nbsp;During this process, Microsoft copied the JavaScript engine
              and source code from Netscape and created their own language
              called JScript. This led to the release of Microsoft's Internet
              Explorer browser, which caused significant difficulties for web
              developers due to the lack of standardization, resulting in
              frequent compatibility issues between browsers.
              <br />
              <br />
              &nbsp;In 1996, Netscape approached the European Computer
              Manufacturers Association (ECMA), an international standardization
              body for information and communication systems, with a proposal to
              create a standard for JavaScript. Consequently, the first ECMA
              Script 1 language specification was published in 1997. ECMA Script
              documents outline the syntactic requirements for creating
              languages and engines that operate in browsers.
              <br />
              <br />
              &nbsp;However, with Internet Explorer's market share rising to
              95%, Microsoft eventually withdrew from participating in the ECMA
              Script standardization.
              <br />
              <br />
              &nbsp;By 2004, Mozilla released the Firefox browser and proposed
              to ECMA to review standardization using their ActionScript 3
              language and the Tamarin engine. However, ECMA decided it was
              impractical to create a new standard since JavaScript and its
              associated engine were already established. This led to intense
              competition between Netscape, Microsoft, and Mozilla over
              standardization. During this period, Jesse James Garrett
              introduced AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), which enabled
              asynchronous data handling between servers and clients. The web
              development market expanded with libraries like jQuery, Dojo, and
              Mootools.
              <br />
              <br />
              &nbsp;In 2008, Google released its Chrome browser, which featured
              a powerful Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation engine, greatly speeding
              up JavaScript execution. At this time, the four
              companies—Netscape, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Google—discussed
              standardization.
              <br />
              <br />
              &nbsp;In 2009, ECMAScript 5 was finalized. Afterwards,

              There is a growing trend towards &nbsp;Single Page Applications
              (SPA), where data is fetched and only the necessary parts of the
              page are updated dynamically. While it is possible to implement
              SPAs using JavaScript alone, frameworks such as React, Angular,
              and Vue have emerged to make this process easier.
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>Node.js</span><br />
              JavaScript, originally designed to add dynamic elements to web
              browsers, has also led to the creation of Node.js. Node.js
              utilizes the V8 JavaScript engine to enable server-side service
              implementation. It allows for the development of mobile
              applications using frameworks like React Native and Cordova, as
              well as desktop applications using Electron.
