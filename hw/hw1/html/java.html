            The Java language was created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems
            in June 1991.

          <p class="title">Why create a new language?</p>
          <p class="content">
            &nbspInitially, Java was developed for embedded software used in
            appliances like toasters, microwaves, and remote controls. Although
            languages such as C and C++ were already in use for hardware, a new
            language was needed. At that time, most computer languages were
            designed to be compiled specifically for particular platforms (or
            operating systems) or hardware. As a result, each platform and CPU
            required its own compiler, leading to high development costs and
            lengthy processes. For example, while C++ programs could be compiled
            for various CPUs, different C++ compilers were needed for each
            platform and CPU.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            &nbspJames Gosling and his colleagues set out to develop a
            cross-platform language with excellent portability, capable of
            running on various environments regardless of the operating system
            or CPU. This goal led to the creation of Java, embodying the "Write
            Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) philosophy.

            <p class="title">Why did they decide to call it Java?</p>
            <p class="content">
              &nbspInitially, the language was not called Java but Oak. James
              Gosling, who was part of Sun Microsystems' Green Team, originally
              named the language GreenTalk after his team. Later, inspired by
              the oak tree outside the office, he changed the name to Oak.
              However, upon discovering that the name Oak was already in use by
              Oak Technologies, he and his colleagues held a meeting to choose a
              new name. Among the candidates like "dynamic," "revolutionary,"
              "Silk," "jolt," and "DNA," they ultimately decided on Java, named
              after the coffee beans from the Indonesian island of Java. (That’s
              probably why the logo features coffee!)
            </p>
            <p class="content">
              &nbspIn conclusion, the language started as Oak in 1991, but from
              version 1.0.2, released in 1996, it has been known as Java.

          <p class="title">Features of Java</p>
          <p class="content">
            &nbspThe developers of Java came from a Unix-based background, so
            the syntax of Java is similar to the C language, which is the
            ancestor of C++. Unlike C++, which added object-oriented features to
            C, Java was developed as an object-oriented language from the start.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            &nbspAs explained earlier, the most significant feature of Java is
            its platform (or OS) and CPU independence. The Java compiler
            converts Java code into a special binary form called Java bytecode.
            To execute Java bytecode, a special virtual machine called the Java
            Virtual Machine (JVM) is required. This virtual machine can run Java
            bytecode in the same way on any platform. As a result, programs
            developed in Java can run anywhere on systems with a JVM installed,
            regardless of the CPU or operating system. This feature aligns well
            with the nature of web applications and contributed to Java's
            explosive popularity.

            <p class="title">Development of Java</p>
            <p class="content">
              &nbspJava rose to prominence with the advent of the Internet and
              the World Wide Web (WWW). The emergence of the web, which demanded
              portable languages, propelled Java to the forefront of computer
              language design projects. Many programmers initially realized that
              while portable programs were desirable, they were also challenging
              to implement, causing platform-independent and highly portable
              program development to fall by the wayside. However, with the rise
              of the Internet and the web, the issue of portability came back
              into focus, as the Internet is a vast distributed system
              overflowing with various computers, operating systems, and CPUs.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
              &nbspIn 1998, the release of J2SE 1.2 introduced Java Applets,
              which allowed Java to run on the web, leading to a surge in Java's
              popularity.

          <p class="title">Recent Developments</p>
          <p class="content">
            &nbspSince then, Java has continued to gain popularity with each new
            version update, adding various features. In 2009, Sun Microsystems
            was acquired by Oracle, and Java's ownership transferred to Oracle
            as well.
