          <p class="content">
            Python is a programming language developed by Guido van Rossum in
            Amsterdam. It was released in 1991 and named "Python." Guido named
            it after a comedy show he liked.
            <br />
            <br />
            (Python also means a type of snake, which is why the Python logo
            features two cute snake characters.)

        <div class="content_box">
          <p class="title">Why Was It Created?</p>
          <p class="content">
            Python began as a hobby project during Guido van Rossum's two-month
            vacation in 1989 while he was working at the National Research
            Institute in the Netherlands. Later, it received funding under the
            name "Computer Programming for Everyone," and thus, Python was
            developed.

          <p class="title">Why Is Python Special?</p>
          <p class="content">
            Python quickly gained popularity among programmers due to its
            simplicity, ease of use, and versatility. Today, it is one of the
            most widely used programming languages in the world and is favored
            in various applications, including web development, data science,
            machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
            <br /><br />
            Python's popularity is driven by its ease of use, versatility, and
            the large, active developer community behind it. Its clean syntax
            makes it easy to write and read, and it supports a wide range of
            programming paradigms, including object-oriented, functional, and
            procedural programming.
            <br /><br />
            Let’s dive into some specific features to understand why it’s so
            special:<br />
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="content">
              The first advantage is simple and easy-to-read code. Python was
              designed to be simpler and more minimal compared to other
              programming languages. The syntax rules are easy to grasp, making
              Python code intuitive, almost like reading regular text. Because
              of this, Python is easy to learn and allows developers to focus
              more on the purpose of the code.
            </li>
            <li class="content">
              The second advantage is its variety of modules and packages.
              Python has a wide range of modules and packages, allowing users to
              extend its functionality and perform various tasks.
            </li>
            <li class="content">
              Third, Python is an object-oriented language. It supports classes
              and objects, which improve code reusability and maintainability.
            </li>
            <li class="content">
              Fourth, Python is cross-platform. This means Python code can run
              on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
            </li>
            <li class="content">
              The fifth advantage is Python’s support for an interactive shell.
              This allows developers to write and execute code immediately,
              making it easier to experiment and debug.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <div class="content_box">
          <p class="title">The Development of Python</p>
          <p class="content">
            Since its initial release, Python has evolved through several
            versions. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, introducing features like
            list comprehensions, while Python 3.0 came out in 2008, introducing
            significant changes and improvements at the cost of backward
            compatibility. Python has continued to evolve, and the Python 3.x
            series is the most widely used today.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content_box">
          <p class="title">The Current State of Python</p>
          <p class="content">
            In recent years, Python has become widely used in fields such as web
            development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI). Python
            plays a major role in data science and machine learning, thanks to
            libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Pandas. It has become one of
            the most important languages in these fields.
            <br /><br />
            Additionally, frameworks supporting microservices, cloud computing,
            and web development are widely used, and Python consistently ranks
            high in programming language popularity surveys.
